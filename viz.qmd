![Three-dimensional city models (top row) and average annual mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) overlays (bottom row) for subsets of two SA1 locations representing low-density (cul-de-sac in Currambine) and high-density (infill site in Subiaco) developments.

![Average annual temperature using the original urban footprint, proposed redevelopment plans, and proposed plans with optimal tree placement. Also indicated are the average annual minimum, mean, and maximum mean radiant temperature with color-coded circles for each urban footprint scenario. The proposed redevelopment constitutes increased building height and variation across the site enlarging shading potential, reducing site mean radiant temperature compared to the original urban area.
