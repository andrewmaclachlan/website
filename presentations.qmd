## Hi, come on in

::: {#hero-heading}

Aside from a brief stint in industry I've been in academia my whole career. My expertise lies in remote sensing, although in recent years this has expanded to any project using spatial data and geographical information science...

> "A jack of all trades is a master of none, ***but oftentimes better than a master of one**"*

I teach, develop courses, conduct research and apply / maintain a variety of student funding and accreditation. All of which you'll find on this site!  

R is my language of choice, but I also use PostGIS and Google Earth Engine.

## About me

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6 #me-1}

I've invested time in making my teaching and research resources open and reproducible. In doing so I set an example for my students and hope they are useful to a much wider audience.  

During my studies I spent time at the University of Wollongong during my undergradaute and at the University of Western Australia during my PhD.
